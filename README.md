# 🛒 Product List with Cart

This is a solution to the [Product list with cart challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d). This challenge helped me practice building a responsive and interactive shopping cart interface using **React**, including managing state, handling modals, and dynamic UI updates.

- See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order."  
- Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order."  
- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size.  
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements.
